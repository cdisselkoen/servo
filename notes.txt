is_visited_link() in dom.rs returns false
is called in style_adjuster.rs by adjust_for_visited() (which sets ComputedValueFlags::IS_RELEVANT_LINK_VISITED on self.style)
  which is called by StyleAdjuster::adjust()
    which is called in properties.mako.rs by apply_declarations()
      which is called in three places: in stylist.rs by Stylist::compute_for_declarations()
        which appears to not be called in Servo; and a note in style_adjuster.rs seems to imply this is only for Gecko
      and also in animation.rs by compute_style_for_animation_step()
        which is called (twice) by update_style_for_animation()
          which is called in matching.rs by update_animations_for_cascade()
            which is called by process_animations() [NOTE issue#20116]
              which is called in several places. At this point I don't think the animations code is critical, we should start with the common case
      and also in properties.mako.rs by cascade_rules()
        which is called in two places: in cascade() (as distinguished from CustomPropertiesBuilder::cascade())
          (This is a major function, mentioned in docs/components/style.md)
            which is called in stylist.rs by cascade_style_and_visited()
              which is called in two places: by compute_pseudo_element_style_with_inputs()
                TODO
              and also in style_resolver.rs by its own cascade_style_and_visited()
                which is called by several callers in that file: by cascade_styles_with_default_parents()
                  which is called (twice) in traversal.rs by compute_style()
                    TODO
                and also by cascade_style_and_visited_with_default_parents()
                    TODO
                and also by resolve_pseudo_style()
                    TODO
                and also by cascade_primary_style()
                    which is called by two callers: by resolve_primary_style()
                      which is called in two places: in the pub struct method resolve_style() on StyleResolverForElement
                        which is called in two places: in the pub function resolve_style() in style/traversal.rs
                          [see below]
                        and also by resolve_style_with_default_parents()
                          TODO
                      and also in the pub function resolve_style() in style/traversal.rs
                        which is called in layout/query.rs by process_resolved_style_request()
                          which is called in layout_thread/lib.rs by respond_to_query_if_necessary(), a method on the LayoutThread struct
                    and also by cascade_styles_with_default_parents()
                      TODO
        and also in apply_declarations()
          [see line 4-5]
and is also called in style/sharing/mod.rs
  which surrounding comments clearly indicate isn't the main code path, just an optimization
